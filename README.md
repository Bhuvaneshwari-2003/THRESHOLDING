# THRESHOLDING
## Aim
To segment the image using global thresholding, adaptive thresholding and Otsu's thresholding using python and OpenCV.

## Software Required
1. Anaconda - Python 3.7
2. OpenCV

## Algorithm

### Step1:
Start the Program

### Step2:


### Step3:


### Step4:


### Step5:


## Program

```python
# Load the necessary packages





# Read the Image and convert to grayscale




# Use Global thresholding to segment the image




# Use Adaptive thresholding to segment the image




# Use Otsu's method to segment the image 




# Display the results





```
## Output

### Original Image


### Global Thresholding


### Adaptive Thresholding


### Optimum Global Thesholding using Otsu's Method



## Result
Thus the images are segmented using global thresholding, adaptive thresholding and optimum global thresholding using python and OpenCV.
